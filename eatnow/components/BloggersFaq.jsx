    "Article Assistant (Base model) is a free model that lets your readers ask questions about your blog articles on ReBlug. Your readers for example can ask about the certain terminologies, words, concepts you defined within the stories, and it will provide accurate answers while the readers are still on the page - No need for them to navigate away to another site for answers. The base model can also be used for research on articles to help readers better understand what your article is about while trying to derive values and insights. The Article Assistant (Advanced model) does everything that the base model does and more, it also provides additional features such as 'Accept Sponsorship from brands', 'Double up as Sales agent for use in our bCommerce feature enabled on the page', nudges readers to subscribe to your blog, collect reader information in any case they want to contact you or have questions that goes beyond your article.",
    "The concept of Foodhini is to develop a tool that serves as liaison between brand partners and community members. Foodhini connects brands who are eager to reach new audiences and are willing to invest heavily in doing so with members. We want to reward you for your activity on the platform! You'll be compensated for every interaction with our brand partners starting from day one. We believe it's a Win-win situation as brands benefit from organic content sharing and real experiences, while you get rewarded for your participation. To jumpstart your experience, we're providing a 'no-commitment' $30 deposit in a virtual card for you, and you may use this as form of payment to get started with tools such as 'Eat Now, Pay Never', and we encourage you to place food orders from local restaurants listed on the platform as these restaurants provides incentives that aren't available on other food delivery platforms(e.g. Get notified to pick up free deserts, coffee, ice cream or get VIP treatments if you decide to dine in at their location - These are part of our agreement when we partnered and onboarded them on the platform). The $30 is roughly the average cost of an order from local restaurants and food providers listed on the platform. You may save to stack up the funds or spend it online as you see fit.",
